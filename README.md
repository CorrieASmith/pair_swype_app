## Description

_This is a social media network that allows Epicodus students from all cohorts to schedule dates to pair up together. Users are able to create an account, interact with other users, take a simple Epicodus preferences survey and edit or delete their profile.
An admin feature is available to those who run the website, which allows the admin in question to edit and/or delete questions from the preferences survey.
Trial accounts have already been created in the database which are visible in the seeds.rb file._
